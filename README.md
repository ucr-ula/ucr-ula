### Program Overview

The UCR CS ULA program started in Fall 2021. The goals of the program are to:
- improve the learning experience of students in core CS courses
- build a sense of community amongst undergraduate students
- create a supportive environment for underrepresented groups in CS

Towards this, students will be hired and trained as undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs) to act as peer tutors for selected CSE classes.
ULAs will provide open "help desk" hours at a specific location (TBD) in Winston Chung Hall, or online through Zoom, and assist students with course content, homeworks, labs, etc.

The UCR CS ULA program is managed by Prof. Jiasi Chen with help from Profs. Paea LePendu, Mariam Salloum, Tamar Shinar, and Yihan Sun.

### Winter 2022 ULAs

| Picture            | Name |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  ![Image of Aaron](images/aaron.jpg)           | **Aaron**: Hi! I'm Aaron, a senior in computer science at UCR. I'm graduating in the class of 2022 but plan on getting my masters degree in 2023. Even though I'm a senior, this year is my first year physically on campus, which will certainly be lots of fun! I decided to be a ULA because I find myself helping other students in my classes all the time. I seem to have figured out this whole college thing by now, so I want to use my knowledge to pay it forward to anyone willing to lend an ear. My random fact is that I'm a fanatic for japanese arcade games! I love to go Round1 after class and play Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania all night!        |
| ![Image of Brij](images/brij.jpg)      |  **Brij**: Hi! My name's Brij and I’m a Junior studying Computer Science. I wanted to be a ULA, because I really like to teach and see the “spark” in people’s eyes when they finally understand something. I also have some prior tutoring experience, and really enjoyed it, so wanted to give it another shot in college. A random fact about me is that I can solve a Rubiks cube in under a minute.       |
|  ![Image of Celvin](images/celvin.jpeg)           | **Celvin**: Hello everyone! My name is Celvin (pronounced Selvin).  I am a first year graduate Computer Science student at UCR and I will be graduating this Spring. Teaching and mentoring has always been a passion of mine. For about five years, I taught high school students how to play percussion instruments, specifically for marching band. Since I am leaving UCR soon, I wanted to leave my imprint on the community with something that I am passionate about…teaching! This is why I decided to become a ULA. A random fact about me is that (as you may have guessed), I love playing drums!    |
|  ![Image of Cody](images/cody.PNG)           | **Cody**: I am Cody, a second year computer science major. I am excited to be a ULA because learning to solve problems individually is my passion, so in my freshman year, I loved explaining my strategies to learn and succeed in any class while helping my friends with specific classes. A fun fact about me is that I am learning Hindi!       |
| ![Image of Diane](images/diane.jpg)            | **Diane**: I am a third year computer science major and I wanted to be a ULA because helping people is lots of fun and I was in the same boat before as well! A random fact about me is that my hearing is not very good so one of the words I most often say is "huh".       |
| ![Image of Edgar](images/edgar.jpg)            | **Edgar**: My name is Edgarventura, but I usually only go by Edgar. I'm a second year Computer Science major who upon finding himself lost trying to navigate college life, found himself being helped by all kinds of people such as professors, counselors, and even other students. Which is why I really wanted to become a ULA, because I wanted nothing more than to return a little bit of the kindness I received back into the UCR community. A little fun fact about myself is that over the pandemic I began teaching myself how to play the harmonica, and so far I've been enjoying it quite a lot!        |
| ![Image of Gabriel](images/gabriel.jpg)            | **Gabriel**: Hi everyone, I'm Gabriel, a junior at UCR. I'm a CS major, and I wanted to become a tutor because I'm interested in being a professor myself one day and this seemed like a good place to start. I'm into a wide genre of video games and love pizza.        |
| ![Image of Joshua](images/joshua.jpeg)            | **Joshua**: Hi! My name is Joshua and I'm a sophomore computer science major. I wanted to be a ULA because I enjoy teaching and helping others, and I have a passion for what we're learning in these classes. A random fact about me is that I am a huge basketball nerd.         |
|  ![Image of Taneesha](images/taneesha.jpg)            | **Taneesha**: I am a Computer Science Major. This is my second year at UCR, so I am a sophomore. I decided to join the ULA because I understand the feeling of being lost and hesitating to reach out for help, and all we need is reassurance and a little help to discover our potential. I love helping people with the resources that I have. A random fact about me is that I love eating spicy food and challenging myself to eat the spiciest that I can get. I am also a huge fan of the boyband BTS! |
