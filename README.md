## UCR CSE Undergraduate Learning Assistants Program

### Program Overview

The UCR CS ULA program is launching in Fall 2021. The goals of the program are to:
- improve the learning experience of students in core CS courses
- build a sense of community amongst undergraduate students
- create a supportive environment for underrepresented groups in CS

Towards this, students will be hired and trained as undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs) to act as peer tutors for selected CSE classes.
ULAs will provide open "help desk" hours at a specific location (TBD) in Winston Chung Hall, and assist students with course content, homeworks, labs, etc.

The UCR CS ULA program is managed by Prof. Jiasi Chen with help from Profs. Paea LePendu, Mariam Salloum, Tamar Shinar, and Yihan Sun.

### We're Hiring!

We are currently hiring ULAs for the following topic areas:

- Software: CS 10A, 10B, 10C (formerly known as CS 10, 12, 14)
- Algorithms: CS 111, 141
- Embedded systems: CS 61

### ULA Responsibilities

ULAs will have shifts in the help desk room (TBD in Winston Chung Hall), and tutor any drop-in students with questions about the course. ULAs will work for approximately 10 hours/week, broken up into 2-3 shifts (exact schedule TBD based on the ULAs' individual availability). The pay rate for ULAs is expected to be around $16-17/h, commensurate with other tutoring programs on campus.

If selected, ULAs must enroll in CS190: Apprentice Teaching for Undergraduates in Fall'21. This will be a weekly 1-hour seminar on computer science education worth 2 credits, taken S/NC, and will discuss current best practices for CS education. It will be led by Prof. Chen and modeled on similar courses (e.g., at [UCSB](https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/w21/)).
