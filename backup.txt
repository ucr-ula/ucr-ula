<!--| ![Image of Brij](images/brij.jpg)      |  **Brij**: Hi! My name's Brij and I’m a Junior studying Computer Science. I wanted to be a ULA, because I really like to teach and see the “spark” in people’s eyes when they finally understand something. I also have some prior tutoring experience, and really enjoyed it, so wanted to give it another shot in college. A random fact about me is that I can solve a Rubiks cube in under a minute.       |-->
